                <p>America was a great experiment in democracy where the power to make decisions was given to the public. The line between rulers and subjects was blurred and freedoms flourished. This website is inspired by this American genesis. Popular social media websites are criticized for unjustly banning users for voicing opinions that belong to specific political parties or maintaining a narrative that aligns with their administrators personal beliefs or their stakeholders. While the public debated whether this was an infringement on free-speech, a billionaire decided to buy an entire social media company to address this issue. Now the public fears he has too much power. Who will he ban and where will he draw the line? </p>
                <p>This website has no administrators or monitors. The community of users will monitor itself. If you find something offensive, unconstructive, or just mean, downvote it. Once a comment’s or post’s downvote make up 60% of its overall likes and dislikes, poof! It’s gone. This is to eliminate the possibility of a noisy few distorting how the majority actually feel on a topic. We give the power back to the people and have faith that the majority will more accurately express a narrative that is representative of the general public. Draw the Line™ is an experiment in digital democracy. </p>
                <p>Socrates famously said, “True knowledge exists knowing that you know nothing”. Every human is thrown into this world of randomness and all try to make sense of it with our ideas. We promote the philosophy that humans should not be married to their ideas and it’s ok to change your mind. Changing your mind is not an admission of error if you were never claiming to be correct to begin with. We hope this website promotes healthy, civil debate that will lead to personal growth and a better understanding of the opposition.</p>
